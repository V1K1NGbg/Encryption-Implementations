# Encryption-Implementations
Testing some encryption methods using different common encryption methods


You can make it CLI (kind of) on Linux (only in the current shell!) by running:

```bash
alias dec="node {PATH_TO_REPO}/Encryption-Implementations/HillCipher/dec.js"
alias enc="node {PATH_TO_REPO}/Encryption-Implementations/HillCipher/enc.js"
```
